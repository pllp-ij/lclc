NOTE:
    in 
        method2-DFS-with-hashmap/DFS-recursion-implementation/,
    Compared to V1, V2, V3, the method V5 is a recursive method with return type,
    in V1, V2, V3, each level of recursive only process current node and next level node, but
    in V5, the recursion will finish all nodes from next level to the end, so the code in V5 is more neat
    
    Left question:
        In V1, V2, V3, not only for DFS-recursion-implementation, actually in all other positions where these three version of
        code exist, there should be two seperate cache data structure to be used, one is for storing all nodes that has been visited,
        another one is for recording every pair relationship between current level and next level.
        But in V5, there is only one map needed, because within each recursion, the next level will be finished completely from next level to the end,
        so there is no need for two cache
