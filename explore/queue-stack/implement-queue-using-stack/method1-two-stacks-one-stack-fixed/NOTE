NOTE:
    method1-two-stacks-one-stack-fixed/MyQueueV1 is under assumption:
        stack1 top is the head of queue
        stack1 bottom is the tail of queue
    
    method1-two-stacks-one-stack-fixed/MyQueueV2 is under assumption:
        stack1 top is the tail of queue
        stack2 bottom is the head of queue
        
    the reason there are V1, V2 two version in
        method1-two-stacks-one-stack-fixed/
    but only V1 one version in 
        method2-two-stacks-alternative
    is that in method2, the two stack are symmetric, so switch head or tail of queue doesn't matter
